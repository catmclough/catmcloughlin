              When I go on vacation I like to take a book that's set in or near
              my destination. So, inspired by the
              <a href="https://apps.npr.org/best-books/#view=covers&year=2020"
                >NPR Book Concierge</a
              >
              and <a href="https://dauntbooks.co.uk/">Daunt Books</a>, I created
              a personal database of books organized by setting or other
              associated locations.
            </p>
            <p>
              The books are currently curated by myself, but this is a work in
              progress! I'd like to add support for cities, states and regions,
              a better experience for adding new books including book covers,
              and links to purchase any given book.
            </p>
            <p>
              This app served as my introduction to React. It uses a Firebase DB
              and the Google Books API for book creation.

              I created this game in 2013 for a class at NYU called Interactive
              Computing. The code is written in ProcessingJS (now
              <a href="https://p5js.org/" target="_blank">p5.js</a>).
            </p>
            <p>
              Frogger Soccer is a chase game where you are the ball and your
              goal is to find the net. If you run into a defender, you've been
              tackled and have to start at the beginning. See how many goals you
              can score before being tackled five times.
            </p>
            <p>
              This was the first game I ever created. The challenge lied in
              learning how to track the movement of elements in a Processing
              program and handle collisions between them. This was also my first
              time creating a game loop and handling score tracking and
              resetting after a game has ended.
            </p>
            <p>
              The defenders are original drawings by myself, done using
              <a href=" https://make8bitart.com/">'make 8-bit art'</a> by

              Another collision-based game done for the mid-term of my
              Interactive Computing class at NYU. This one uses mouse-tracking
              and was completed in-class in about an hour.

            <p>
              I made this weird little game in 2012 as a project for my CS101
              class at NYU. The class taught OO concepts in Java and this
              project was meant to display my understanding of interfaces. It
              uses the Processing library's PApplet to draw the visualizations
              as well as the Minim library to make cool space sounds.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the game, you are a black hole that consumes other space things
              as you move around. If you'd like to play you can
              follow

                >the instructions in the README</a
              >
              to run the project locally.

              I made this little visualizer in 2012 as one of my first
              assignments in CS101 at NYU. It draws triangles whose position and
              color change based on the position of the mouse. Useful!
            </p>
            <p>
              It's written in Java using the Processing library's PApplet to
              draw the graphics. If you'd like to see it in action you can
