              When I go on vacation I like to take a book that's set in or near
              my destination. So, inspired by the
              <a href="https://apps.npr.org/best-books/#view=covers&year=2020"
                >NPR Book Concierge</a
              >
              and <a href="https://dauntbooks.co.uk/">Daunt Books</a>, I created
              a personal database of books organized by setting or other
              associated locations.
            </p>
            <p>
              The books are currently curated by myself, but this is a work in
              progress! I'd like to add support for cities, states and regions,
              a better experience for adding new books including book covers,
              and links to purchase any given book.
            </p>

              This app served as my introduction to React. It uses a Firebase DB
              and the Google Books API for book creation.

              I created this game for a class called Interactive Computing. The
              code is written in ProcessingJS (now
              <a href="https://p5js.org/" target="_blank">p5.js</a>).
            </p>
            <p>
              Frogger Soccer is a chase game where you are the ball and your
              goal is to find the net. If you run into a defender, you've been
              tackled and have to start at the beginning. See how many goals you
              can score before being tackled five times.
            </p>
            <p>
              This was the first game I ever created. The challenge lied in
              learning how to track the movement of elements in a Processing
              program and handle collisions between them. This was also my first
              time creating a game loop and handling score tracking and
              resetting after a game has ended.
            </p>
            <p>
              The defenders are original drawings by myself, done using
              <a href=" https://make8bitart.com/">'make 8-bit art'</a> by
              <a href="https://jennmoney.biz/">Jen Schiffer</a>.

              Another collision-based game, this one with mouse-tracking. Avoid
              the witch and the ghost, which appear at random y-coordinates and
              fly through the screen while you try to collect more candy corn
              than they do.
            </p>
            <p>
              This game was part of my mid-term in the interactive computing
              class. I completed it in-class in about an hour.

              I made this little visualizer in 2013 as one of my first
              assignments in CS101 at NYU. It draws triangles whose position and
              color change based on the position of the mouse. Useful!
            </p>
            <p>
              It's written in Java using the Processing library's PApplet to
              draw the graphics. If you'd like to see it in action you can
              follow
